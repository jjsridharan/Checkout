In colleges students have to meet their teachers more often. They will look for teachers in cabin or in some classes. If the teacher is not there in cabin, student has to wait until he/she comes back. To overcome this problem, we have designed an app that will say the current location of teachers inside the campus and the time when they will return to their cabin. There will be three kinds of users for this app. Admin, Teacher and Student. Admin is any person who is in department office, they can add teachers in their department and update important information. Teacher can change their current location and announce important instructions to students. Students can view the status of teachers and view important instructions posted by department office and teachers. With this app, students can plan their visit to meet teachers. Students can use their time effectively by planning their visits. Admin(department office) can post important circular information. Students can be notified instantly for important information from admin(department office) and teachers.
